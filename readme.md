Challenge Description https://gitcoin.co/issue/reef-defi/reef-finance-bounties/2/100026839

Reef chain offers very low transaction fees so it can offer more complex contract functionality and NFT creation will be more accessible to everyone. We are looking for an NFT marketplace dApp with functionality like OpenSea or Rarible. Allow content creators to configure smart contracts for the collection of royalties on their artwork in the future.
